# Cybersecurity-Lab

Below is a Python script that sets up a basic cybersecurity lab and cyber range environment using the turtle library for graphical representation. 

This script will create a graphical window, draw the lab components, and simulate interactions.

This script sets up a graphical window using the turtle library. It creates a turtle for drawing and draws a series of lab components, such as firewalls, VPN servers, web servers, database servers, and workstations. The components are represented by rectangles and their names are written inside them.

The script also simulates interactions with the lab components. When the user clicks on a component, the interact_with_component function is called, and it prints a message indicating which component the user is interacting with.

To run this script, make sure you have the turtle library installed (pip install turtle) and execute the script in a Python environment.

Note: This script provides a basic representation of the cybersecurity lab and cyber range. In a real-world scenario, you would need to expand upon this script to include more components, implement more complex interactions, and handle user input and output in a more interactive manner.
